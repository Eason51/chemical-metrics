[SEP] results and discussion sar development to identify selective jak1 inhibitors , we first screened a 5 0 000-membered subset of our compound collection , which was biased toward motifs known to bind the atp binding site of kinases . initially , three-point ic50 values were determined , and approximately 1 4 0 0 compounds were identified as possessing an ic50 < 1 0 0 nm against jak1 ( km atp concentration , 5 5 μm ) . these compounds were subsequently rescreened in a five-point ic50 format versus jak1 , 2 , and 3 , at the corresponding km atp concentrations ( 5 5 , 1 5 , and 3 μm , respectively ) in order to identify potent and selective starting points for further optimization . through these efforts , we identified compound 3 from our previously described ephb4 program . ( 1 5 ) compound 3 displayed excellent jak1 biochemical potency , as well as moderate selectivity over the other jak family members tested ( table 1 ) . interestingly , we observed that the degree of selectivity toward jak1 appeared to be , in part , determined by the c-2 aniline , with other bis-2 , 4-anilinopyrimidines , such as 4 , showing a preference for jak2 inhibition ( table 1 ) ."}
