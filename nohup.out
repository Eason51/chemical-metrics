[SEP] characterization of a series of 3-amino-2-phenylpropene derivatives as novel bovine chromaffin vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitors a series of 3-amino-2-phenylpropene ( app ) derivatives have been synthesized and characterized as novel competitive inhibitors , with ki values in the μm range , for the bovine chromaffin granule membrane monoamine transporter ( s ) ( bvmat ) . although , these inhibitors are structurally similar to the bvmat substrate tyramine , none of them were measurably transported into the granule . structure−activity studies have revealed that , while the 3‘- or 4‘-oh groups on the aromatic ring enhance the inhibition potency , me or ome groups in these positions reduce the inhibition potency . halogen substitution on the 4‘-position of the aromatic ring causes gradual increase of the inhibition potency parallel to the electron donor ability of the halogen . substituents on the nh2 as well as on the 3-position of the alkyl chain reduce the inhibition potency . comparative structure−activity analyses of app derivatives with tyramine and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium suggest that the flexibility of the side chain and the relative orientation of the nh2 group may be critical for the efficient transport of the substrate through the bvmat . comparable bvmat affinities of these inhibitors to that of da and other pharmacologically active amines suggest that they are suitable for the structure−activity and mechanistic studies of monoamine transporters and may also be useful in modeling'}
